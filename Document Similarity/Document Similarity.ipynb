      "Frequency lists have many applications in the realm of second language acquisition and beyond. One use for such lists in the context of the Wiktionary project is as an aid in identifying missing terms of high-frequency and thus, it is assumed, of high priority. Since English Wiktionary aims not just to be a mere database of lemmas, but a multi-directional, multi-lingual dictionary aimed at English speaking users, there are certain advantages to lists which include inflected forms as well. These forms reflect words as they are likely to be encountered and thus as they may be used in lookup.\n",
      "Feel free to add definitions for words on these lists if you know the languages involved! Even better if you can include usage citations and references. If you are involved in another non-English language edition of Wiktionary, you might also consider implementing or expanding on this idea, if there is not already something similar in place. If you see a word in this list that is clearly out of place (wrong language, punctuation, superfluous capitalisation), you are welcome to remove it. While creating entries for words, please leave valid bluelinks in place as these pages may be copied for use with other language projects in the future.\n",
      "However, this system is far from perfect due to the variable quality of the source data and the automated nature of processing. Thus a word's presence in any of these lists is merely an invitation for further investigation as to whether an entry is warranted. Please be mindful that there will be many words which\n",

      "Frequency lists have many applications in the realm of second language acquisition and beyond. One use for such lists in the context of the Wiktionary project is as an aid in identifying missing terms of high-frequency and thus, it is assumed, of high priority. Since English Wiktionary aims not just to be a mere database of lemmas, but a multi-directional, multi-lingual dictionary aimed at English speaking users, there are certain advantages to lists which include inflected forms as well. These forms reflect words as they are likely to be encountered and thus as they may be used in lookup.\n",
